#Note: I imported Image from PIL as PI because otherwise it would have conflicted with the Image module from wand.image.
#For those on mac and using homebrew, it seems like Wand doesn't support imagemagick 7 yet as mentioned in other answers.

#There's a new brew formula for Imagemagick 6 which can be used to install the older version in the meanwhile:
#brew install imagemagick@6
#Create a symlink to this newly installed dylib file as mentioned in other answer to get things working.
#ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/imagemagick@6/6.9.7-4/lib/libMagickWand-6.Q16.dylib /usr/local/lib/libMagickWand.dylib
